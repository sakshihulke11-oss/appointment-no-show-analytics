# Healthcare Appointment No-Show Analysis

## Project Overview

Missed healthcare appointments reduce operational efficiency, delay patient care, and increase scheduling uncertainty. This project analyzes appointment attendance data to identify no-show patterns and translate them into actionable insights for smarter healthcare scheduling.

The objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end analytics workflow — from data preparation to KPI analysis and dashboard storytelling — focused on decision support rather than simple reporting.

## Dataset

This project uses approximately **111,000 healthcare appointment records** representing real-world patient scheduling and attendance behavior.

The dataset includes:

- Patient and appointment identifiers  
- Scheduled vs appointment timing  
- Age and neighborhood information  
- Chronic condition indicators  
  (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap)  
- SMS reminder status  
- Attendance outcome (no-show flag)

The dataset size enables meaningful segmentation and trend analysis across patient groups.

Dataset location:C:\Users\User\Documents

## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers face unpredictable appointment attendance that impacts operational capacity and patient access.

This analysis investigates:

- Which patient groups show higher no-show behavior  
- Chronic vs non-chronic attendance patterns  
- Neighborhood attendance variation  
- Reminder effectiveness  
- Operational insights to reduce missed visits  

---

## Analytical Workflow

The project follows a structured analytics pipeline:

**Data Cleaning → SQL KPI Analysis → Segmentation → Dashboard Visualization → Decision Insights**

### Excel
- Data standardization  
- Cleaning and preparation  

### SQL
- KPI calculations  
- Patient segmentation  
- Neighborhood analysis  

### Power BI
- Interactive dashboard  
- KPI storytelling  
- Attendance visualization  

---

## Key KPIs Analyzed

- Total appointments  
- Overall no-show rate  
- Average waiting days  
- No-show rate by neighborhood  
- Chronic vs non-chronic attendance  
- Age group behavior  
- SMS reminder effectiveness  

---

## Key Findings

- ~20% of appointments result in no-shows  
- Pediatric chronic patients show higher absence patterns  
- Young adults show greater attendance variability  
- Neighborhood trends reveal localized risk  
- Reminder messages alone do not fully eliminate missed visits  

---

## Decision Insights

Analysis supports operational strategies such as:

- Targeted follow-ups in high-risk neighborhoods  
- Risk-based scheduling  
- Improved reminder workflows  
- Resource prioritization based on attendance patterns
