# 🏥 Healthcare Appointment No-Show Analysis


## 📌 Project Overview

Missed healthcare appointments reduce operational efficiency, delay patient care, and increase scheduling uncertainty. This project analyzes appointment attendance behavior to identify no-show patterns and convert raw healthcare data into actionable operational insights.

The objective is to demonstrate a structured analytics workflow — from data preparation to KPI analysis and dashboard storytelling — focused on decision-driven outcomes.


## 📊 Dataset

This project uses approximately **111,000 healthcare appointment records**, representing real-world scheduling and attendance behavior.

Dataset includes:

- Patient & appointment identifiers  
- Scheduled vs appointment timing  
- Age & neighborhood information  
- Chronic condition indicators  
  (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap)  
- SMS reminder status  
- Attendance outcome (no-show flag)

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare providers face unpredictable appointment attendance, leading to wasted resources and delayed service delivery.

This analysis investigates:

- High-risk patient segments  
- Chronic vs non-chronic attendance patterns  
- Neighborhood-level trends  
- Reminder effectiveness  
- Operational strategies to reduce missed visits

- Average waiting days  
- Neighborhood no-show comparison  
- Chronic vs non-chronic attendance  
- Age group behavior  
- SMS reminder effectiveness  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ~20% of appointments result in no-shows  
- Pediatric chronic patients show elevated absence patterns  
- Young adults demonstrate attendance variability  
- Neighborhood trends reveal localized risk  
- Reminder messages alone do not eliminate missed visits  

---

## 🧠 Decision Insights

Analysis supports:
